What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","\n","**Answer:**  \n","Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is easy to read and write. It is popular due to its simplicity, versatility, large community support, and wide applications in data science, web development, automation, and artificial intelligence."],"metadata":{"id":"itDkmO58iJqj"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","**Answer:**  \n","An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes code line-by-line, translating it into machine code at runtime. Pythonâ€™s interpreter allows for easier debugging and testing."],"metadata":{"id":"jwBGqxSpjRKp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","**Answer:**  \n","Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and purposes, such as `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `True`, `False`, etc. They cannot be used as variable names."],"metadata":{"id":"i0OBNfkCjrAO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"jzu9sER4jyUo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q4.

What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","**Answer:**  \n","Mutability refers to whether an object can be changed after it is created. Mutable objects like lists can be modified, while immutable objects like tuples and strings cannot be changed after creation."],"metadata":{"id":"aBc4GEy5kGLt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","**Answer:**  \n","Lists are designed to be dynamic and allow changes such as adding, removing, or modifying elements. Tuples, on the other hand, are meant to be fixed and secure, which is why they are immutable."],"metadata":{"id":"gQ_wbDrIkOxm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q7.

What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","**Answer:**  \n","Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another, such as converting a string to an integer using `int()`, or an integer to a string using `str()`."],"metadata":{"id":"UCmfzJawkr9L"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","**Answer:**  \n","- Implicit type casting is done automatically by Python when it converts a data type to another.\n","- Explicit type casting is done manually by the programmer using functions like `int()`, `float()`, or `str()`."],"metadata":{"id":"7f64vY3DkzcF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","\n","**Answer:**  \n","Conditional statements help in decision-making by executing different blocks of code based on certain conditions using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements."],"metadata":{"id":"LjanBfN7lFQK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q12. Where does the `elif` statement work?\n","\n","**Answer:**  \n","The `elif` (else if) statement is used when multiple conditions need to be checked.
